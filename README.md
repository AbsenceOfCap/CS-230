The client was The Gaming Room, and we helped expand the draw it or lose it game to more plantforms, and improved functionality to their software.

I did really well at researching the parts about what platforms we want to have development on. We put a lot of time at looking and comparing all the different platforms and what they had to offer in terms of tools/cost.

The design document helped guide my work, it gave me clear instructions on what to look for and research, as well as my next steps or thoughts and considerations on what platforms and tools I would use in this project.

I really lacked detail in the last part in the recommendations. I would go back and allot myself much more time to add detail and paint more clear pictures for the reader if I could.

The users needs are at the peak of our considerations. The user needs the ability to have this game function across multiple platforms, and for platforms and devices that don't offer too much for hardware. We had to put a lot of thought into optimization for the user with memory techniques.

I think having a document like this to guide my productivity will be instrumental to my future success. I approached it in the order of the document. The principle of doing things in a correct order and not moving on until the immediate challenge is out of the way is ideal.
